    "paragraph": "Between 1000 and 1500, Bantu-speaking peoples migrated southwards from central and eastern Africa, reaching present-day South Africa. This movement introduced languages like isiZulu, isiXhosa, and Sesotho, which became the foundation of the region’s linguistic diversity. These languages shaped cultural identities and oral traditions long before European contact. Their spread laid the groundwork for South Africa’s multilingual society.",

This introduced Dutch, which later evolved into Afrikaans, into the region’s linguistic mix alongside indigenous Khoisan languages. The settlement marked the beginning of European colonization, altering the linguistic landscape through trade and governance.
