            <h3>Colonial Foundation of South Africa</h3>
            <p>Dutch East India Company establishes a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, leading to the first European colonization. British forces seize the Cape Colony in 1806, beginning a period of British colonial rule and conflict with Dutch settlers (Boers). The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) intensifies European colonization and exploitation.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: The colonial period established patterns of racial hierarchy and land dispossession that would later be formalized under apartheid and continue to influence modern land reform debates.</div>

            <h3>Formation of the Union of South Africa</h3>
            <p>The Union of South Africa is established as a dominion of the British Empire, unifying four colonies. Early segregation policies are implemented, including the 1913 Native Land Act, which restricted Black land ownership to designated reserves comprising just 7% of the country's land.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: The geographic and economic disparities established during this period continue to shape settlement patterns and economic opportunities in contemporary South Africa.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1948</div>
            <h3>Apartheid Officially Begins</h3>
            <p>The National Party gains power and institutionalizes racial segregation under the apartheid system. The Population Registration Act of 1950 classifies all South Africans by race, affecting every aspect of daily life including marriage, education, and freedom of movement.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: Modern South African identity documents still reflect racial classifications, though now voluntary, highlighting the persistent impact of historical categorization on contemporary society.</div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1960</div>
            <h3>Sharpeville Massacre</h3>
            <p>Police open fire on peaceful protesters in Sharpeville, killing 69 people. The event marks a turning point in South African history, leading to increased international condemnation and the banning of the ANC and PAC, forcing these organizations underground.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: The date is now commemorated as Human Rights Day, serving as a reminder of the cost of resistance and the importance of protecting civil rights.</div>

            <h3>Rivonia Trial and Mandela's Imprisonment</h3>
            <p>Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders are sentenced to life imprisonment. Mandela's powerful speech from the dock becomes a symbol of resistance. His imprisonment on Robben Island lasts 27 years, during which he becomes the world's most famous political prisoner.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: Robben Island is now a museum and World Heritage site, symbolizing both the oppression of apartheid and the triumph of the human spirit.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1976</div>
            <h3>Soweto Uprising</h3>
            <p>Student protests against Afrikaans as the medium of instruction erupt into widespread resistance. Police respond with brutal force, killing hundreds of young protesters. The image of dying Hector Pieterson becomes a powerful symbol of the struggle.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: Youth Day (June 16) commemorates this event, while the uprising's impact on education and language policy continues to influence current debates about decolonizing education.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1985-1993</div>
            <h3>The Third Force and State Violence</h3>
            <p>A covert operation by the apartheid state aims to destabilize anti-apartheid organizations through violence and assassination. The period sees increased violence between different political groups, often secretly instigated by state forces to undermine the liberation movement.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission later exposed these operations, but their impact on community trust and political relationships persists in contemporary South Africa.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1990-1994</div>
            <h3>Transition to Democracy</h3>
            <p>Nelson Mandela is released in 1990, leading to negotiations for democratic transition. The period is marked by political violence but also by remarkable efforts at peaceful resolution, culminating in the first democratic elections in 1994.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: The negotiated transition becomes a model for conflict resolution, though economic inequality remains a challenging legacy of apartheid.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1994</div>
            <h3>Mandela Becomes President</h3>
            <p>In South Africa's first democratic elections, the ANC wins a majority and Nelson Mandela becomes the country's first Black president. His presidency focuses on reconciliation while beginning to address the deep inequalities left by apartheid.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: The "Rainbow Nation" ideal promoted by Mandela continues to influence discussions about national identity and social cohesion in contemporary South Africa, as explored in works like "African Face, Colonial Tongue."</div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="year">1991-1996</div>
            <h3>Dismantling of Apartheid</h3>
            <p>The process of dismantling apartheid begins with the repeal of major apartheid legislation in 1991. The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) negotiations lead to an interim constitution. In 1996, the new Constitution is adopted, establishing a democratic state based on values of human dignity, equality, and freedom. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission begins its work of addressing apartheid-era human rights violations.</p>
            <div class="impact">Legacy: While legal apartheid ended, its social and economic legacy persists in housing patterns, economic inequality, and ongoing debates about land reform and economic transformation. The tension between reconciliation and justice continues to shape national discourse.</div>
